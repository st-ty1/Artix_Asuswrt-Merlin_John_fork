- Packages already pre-installed by "base"- group: (these were installed by initial installation of Artix) 
  bzip2, gawk, gettext, texinfo, groff, autopoint (included in package gettext), libelf1 (as package libelf), libc6 (included in package glibc), ncurses (as dependency of base group package bash)

  autoconf, automake, binutils, bison, flex, gcc, g++, libstdc++ (included in package gcc), libtool, m4, patch, pkg-config (included in package pkgconf)

- Packages to be installed from Arch-repos, with same package name as in Debian/Ubuntu: 
  autogen, dos2unix, gconf-editor, git (includes gitk too), gperf, intltool, make, mc, mtd-tools, no-dejs, re2c, sqlite (needed by pacakge python2), unzip

- Packages to be installed from Arch-repos, but with altering package name as in Debian:

	zlib1g-dev			->	Zlib (needed by sqlite)
	shtool				->	shtool (AUR)
	libssl-dev			->	openssl-1.0 or openssl (1.1, preinstalled by base group))
