Necessary packages for building Freshtomato on Artix:
- Packages already pre-installed by "base"- group: (these were installed by initial installation of Artix) 
  bzip2, gawk, gettext, texinfo, groff, autopoint (included in package gettext), libelf1 (as package libelf), libc6 (included in package glibc), ncurses (as dependency of base group package bash)

- Packages already preinstalled by “base-devel” group: (these were installed by initial installation of Artix)
  autoconf, automake (1.16), binutils, bison, flex, gcc, g++, libstdc++ (included in package gcc), libtool (2.4.6), m4, patch, pkg-config (included in package pkgconf)

- Packages to be installed from Arch-repos, with same package name as in Debian 9: 
  autogen, dos2unix, gconf-editor, git (includes gitk too), gperf, intltool, make, mc, mtd-tools, no-dejs, re2c, sqlite (needed by pacakge python2), unzip

- Packages to be installed from Arch-repos, but with altering package name as in Debian 9: 

	Debian package name 			Artix package name
		
	zlib1g-dev			->	Zlib (needed by sqlite)
	shtool				->	shtool (AUR)
	libssl-dev			->	openssl-1.0 or openssl (1.1, preinstalled by base group))
	libxml2-dev			->	libxml2
	libglib2.0-dev			->	glib2
	xsltproc			->	libxslt

	lib32-zlib			->	lib32z1-dev

- additional Packages to be installed: 
  rpcsvc-proto (needed by nfs-utils, integrated in former glibcs, but deprecated in newer glibc)
  lib32-glibc (required by lib32-gcc-libs)
  automake-1.15 (due to wget)
  automake 1.11 (due to libdaemon)
