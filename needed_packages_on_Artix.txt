Necessary packages for building Aususwrt on Artix are:
make, gcc, which, autoconf, automake, pkgconf, patch, bison, flex, cmake, rpcsvc-proto, gperf, python, intltool and re2c

The precompiled 32-bit host-tools of FT need following packages: lib32-glibc, lib32-gcc-libs, lib32-zlib and lib32-libelf.
(Therefore, don't forget to uncomment the lines of the "Multilib" and the "lib32" section in /etc/pacman.conf).

For generating/editing Artix-specific patches installing of package diffutils should be helpful.

If you are working with Artix or Arch Linux on wsl2/Windows then you should also install nano-package.

That's all !!!
